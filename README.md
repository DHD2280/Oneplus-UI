# Oneplus UI Library

This library has the scope to look like an Oneplus UI. It is based on the Oxygen Customizer project.

# Installation

To include this library in your Android project, add the following to your Gradle files:

```gradle
allprojects {
    repositories {
      ...
      maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
}

    implementation 'com.github.DHD2280:Oneplus-UI:1.3.8
}
```

# Usage

Use one of these themes in your `themes.xml` file:

`Theme.Oneplus.Light.NoActionBar`
`Theme.Oneplus.Dark.NoActionBar`


Extend your activity to `OplusActivity`, to get dark mode support. [Enhanced/Medium/Gentle]

Extend your `PreferenceFragment` to `OplusPreferenceFragment`, the recycler view will take care of dividers.

# Custom Dividers

You can use dividers by
`
binding.recyclerView.addItemDecoration(new OplusRecyclerView.OplusRecyclerViewItemDecoration(mContext));
`

Then you have to implement the `OplusRecyclerView.IOplusDividerDecorationInterface` class.
